# Dotfiles

Here is my personal collection of dotfiles for various GNU/Linux programs

## Installation

### Vim

To install my vim packages, simply clone the repository and run ``make``. This will automatically replace your ``.vimrc``
file by my one and install all required packages using Vundle. If you want to use YouCompleteMe, please see [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe)
